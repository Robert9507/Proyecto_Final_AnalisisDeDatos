com.kidzcamera,Kidz Camera,6th Element Creations,$0.99 Buy,Simple clean and easy to use camera app for kids. Ad free and no in-app purchases. Kidz Camera is a camera app entirely separate from the phone’s main camera and gallery designed specifically for kids. This kid’s camera app has several features that kids will never know are there and parents can't live without. Stop spending time worrying about your child filling up your phone’s storage with an endless number of fuzzy pictures and pictures of feet. Kidz Camera app contains the following features: Separate Storage: All pictures taken within the camera app stay in the app thus not filling up your main camera gallery. Storage Limit: Set a limit to the number of photos and videos anywhere between 1-50 a child can take within the app. When photos are taken above the limit the oldest photo simply deletes out of the app gallery making room for the new photo. Parent Pin: The parent pin prevents unwanted changes to the settings and allows for the rare good photo to be saved to the device’s main gallery. The parent pin is created the first time the app is opened. After changes are made in the settings the user will be prompted to enter the parent pin before the changes are saved. If the parent pin is entered incorrectly three times the app will simply return to the app camera. Love a Photo: You can export any photos you want to keep from the kid’s camera app gallery to your main gallery by clicking the download icon and simply entering the parent pin. Parent Pin Reset: Don’t know or remember your parent pin? No worries just do a simple math problem. Video Time Limit: Set a maximum number of seconds a video can be up to 60 seconds per video thus allowing videos not to take up all of your storage. Draw on photos: Kids can paint/draw on any photo they want as long as the photo was taken in Kidz Camera app. Optional Delete Entire App Gallery: After a set amount of time (0 to 12 hours) the entire app gallery can automatically be deleted further freeing up your storage. This feature can be turned on or off easily in the settings of the kid’s camera.,July 30 2015,Media & Video Creativity,5.0 7 total,10 - 50,Everyone,3.0 and up,https://www.google.com/url?q=http://kidscameraapp.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFSq_yrvQxUafPZn0SSu1MDbBdLdw * mailto:Kidzcamera@gmail.com * https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/10GqeQ67eE0p-vh9HlK9fJtbF3O_ld9rxsOy588MSBxk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNH2eaZ_mAckwcjG4f-bOLjmqPGfXw,http://kidscameraapp.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFSq_yrvQxUafPZn0SSu1MDbBdLdw,http://kidscameraapp.com,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kidzcamera&hl=en

org.dsandler.apps.markers,Markers,Daniel Sandler,Free,Markers is a simple multitouch pressure-sensitive drawing app. Some of its features include: Pressure sensitivity that works with most Android devices: As more of your finger or capacitive stylus touches the glass Markers will draw a thicker line. NOTE: It may take a minute or two of continuous drawing for Markers to adjust to your device’s touch panel so be patient! (If your device has an active stylus like the Galaxy Note or HTC Flyer the true stylus pressure will be used instead.) Multitouch painting: Two fingers make two lines three make three and so on up to the limits of your device (typically 5 simultaneous touches for phones and 10 for tablets). Kid-friendly interface: Every pen size and color is on-screen; multitouch drawing means accidental touches (such as kid hands on the edges of the display) won't prevent any little fingers from painting. Plays well with others: Share your drawings to other apps and share images into Markers to draw on top of them. [New in 1.2] Pan and zoom: By far the #1 most requested Markers feature! Tap the hand tool to switch into zoom mode; use one finger to scroll and two to zoom. [New in 1.2] Adjustable brushes: Longpress a brush and drag to adjust the minimum and maximum widths. [New in 1.2] Android 4.4 (KitKat) immersive mode: When you tap the Markers icon to hide the palettes the status and navigation bars hide too; you can use the entire screen to draw. Tap the icon to show everything again. Questions? Bugs? Ideas? Click “Email Developer” below. Got a great drawing to share with the world? Share it with +Markers on Google+: http://dsandler.org/markers/+ Markers is open source software; the code is available here: http://dsandler.org/markers Thanks for all your kind words and support! ♥ FAQ Why is my drawing all black when I save it to Gallery? — The drawing is actually on a transparent background so you're seeing Gallery's black background through it. When you load it back into Markers or send it to another app you'll see that the drawing is intact. If you'd prefer an opaque background longpress on a color swatch in the palette to set the paper color. What's up with the pressure sensitivity on my device? — See http://code.google.com/p/markers-for-android/wiki/DeviceSupport for known issues about individual devices.,February 20 2014,Media & Video Creativity,4.0 6539 total,500000 - 1000000,Everyone,2.0 and up,https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dsandler.org/markers&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGGonx-XXZQ6dMLWBnZtGmbR_-l3g * mailto:dsandler+markers@dsandler.org * https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/dsandler/markers/wiki/PrivacyPolicy&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHOQfM22LBr7jUOkVoW63JCzDfnRQ,http://dsandler.org/markers&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGGonx-XXZQ6dMLWBnZtGmbR_-l3g,http://dsandler.org,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dsandler.apps.markers&hl=en

The score for each set of tiles is as follows: 2 tiles = 50 points 3 = 100 points 4 = 150 points 5 = 200 points If the sum is not correct the tiles will not disappear and you should disable those you think necessary to achieve the desired result. Remember that time is running out! When less than 8 tiles remain on the screen the 'Pass' button lights up. When clicked the next level will appear and 25 seconds will be added to your clock. When you manage to remove all of a panel's tiles ('Perfect') you get 50 seconds added to your clock and the score multiplier (located under the 'Pass' button) goes up to the next level (x1-x2-x3-x4-x5-x10). This multiplies the points of each group of tiles so that a group of 2 tiles with the multiplier at x10 = 500 points. If there are 8 or more tiles remaining and you cannot add any more as a last resort you can use the 'Panic' button to move to the next level. Remember that you can press that botton only three times per game. NumSum has 5 Maps available with different degrees of difficulty:. The Decimal Number Map (1-9) with targets ranging from 5 to 25. The Dice Map (1-6) with targets ranging from 5 to 24. The Roman Numeral Map (1-10) with targets ranging from 5 to 40. The Card Map (1-13) [AK] with targets ranging from 5 to 50. The Hexadecimal Numbers Map (1-15) [1-F] with targets ranging from 5 to 60. In the store you can buy lives as well as open whichever Map you wish. Once you have purchased a map it will be available provided that you have lives to play it. Lives can be used on any map you have opened. Enjoy this simple but addictive challenge which also trains your brain. Do you know how to add?...

touchnsay.staerkel.org,touch-n-say,Christopher Stärkel,Free,Many people with autism or other medical conditions suffer from a restricted ability to speak making it difficult for them to communicate with others. A free and easy to use software for smartphones with android technology has now been released to help. Eight simple drawings on the touchscreen symbolize different situations. When a picture is touched the corresponding sentence is verbalized by “touch-n-say” e.g. touching the sandwich symbol prompts the smartphone to say: “I am hungry”. Additionally the user can switch between English German French and Spanish. Developers Conni and Chris Stärkel hope to help people with disabilities to communicate and better participate in social life.

cz.kve.guessword,Popiš slovo,kve,Free,Skupinová hra. Ať už chcete zlepšit své vyjadřovací schopnosti nebo se jen pobavit s přáteli jste tu správně. Ve dvojicích popisujete jednotlivá slova tak aby ho poznal druhý z dvojice (který slovo nevidí). Kolik slov dokážete popsat během dvou minut? A jak jsou na tom vaši přátelé? Ve hře je přes 13 000 slov (vše podstatná jména jednotného čísla). Na začátku hry jsou náhodně promíchána. Po startu hry se určí dvojice mohou se náhodně proházet. Poté se připraví první z nich (hra napoví kdo se připraví kdo bude napovídat a kdo hádat). Může se začít hrát. Dvě minuty se postupně zobrazují slova a hráč je popisuje svému spoluhráči. Uhodne-li přičte si bod nedokáže-li slovo popsat řekne si o další. Po dvou minutách nastupuje další dvojice. Když se všechny dvojice vystřídají hra pokračuje dál stejně. Kdo napovídal hádá a obráceně. Po druhém kole se ukáže jaké dvojici šlo popisování nejlépe. Může se pokračovat dále a například promíchat dvojice. Hra je podobná televizní souteži kufr případně její nové úpravě kurňa co to je. Ve známe společenské hře aktivity též najdete podobnou část.

coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4,4 Player Reactor (Multiplayer),cool cherry trees,€0.99 Buy,4 Player Reactor is the original fast clean and funny reaction game for two to four players on the same device. Challenge your friends (or enemies) to a multiplayer battle of reflexes wits and knowledge! Great as a bar game ice breaker or to decide who has to do the dishes. One of 28 (we continuously add more) exciting mini-games is displayed on screen and if you think the answer is correct hit your button faster than your opponents to get a point. But be careful - hit it at the wrong time and you'll lose one. After a few seconds the next multiplayer challenge starts - and you can make up for lost points or extend your lead against your adversary! ---- Benefits of 4 Player Reactor: ---- 28 (and growing) games with four difficulties each ranging from easy to insane -- that means over 100 combinations! A single-player training mode when you want to hone your skills for the next encounter no advertisements whatsoever and lots of extra settings for even more multiplayer fun! ---- Up to four players on the same device! ---- Nobody needs to wait two three or four players one device at the same time! Frantic multiplayer action is guaranteed for all ages! Some of the included mini-games require pure reaction so the younger you are the better while other mini-games require knowledge of countries in the world and puzzle-solving skills. Who can be the best in all of them? ---- Lots of dynamic Minigames! ---- There are 28 mini-games included and they span all sorts of areas. For example: Who can find the sad face in a group of smiley faces? Does the shown capital city really belong to the country? Can the mouse navigate the maze to the cheese? Hit when the screen turns white! When is the changing labyrinth completed from corner to corner? Has the Countdown hit Zero? React when the Tic-Tac-Toe game is complete! And there's many more! ---- Old-School clean graphics ---- Sporting super-clean and slick graphics 4 Player Reactor doesn't try to overwhelm or distract you with fancy effects or big explosions.This also means it runs on even the oldest and crankiest of Android devices! Everything in the game has been tested on all kinds of screens and it runs beautifully on tablets! ---- Settings to suit everyone! ---- There's a no-brainer "Quick Game" mode that allows you to jump right into the action. But if you hate math or you only want to play that mode with the smiley faces or you want a really really long game you can change everything in the advanced settings menu! And if you're trying to learn a different language we've got you covered: The game has been translated into 25 mysterious languages such as German French Chinese Persian Finnish and many many more. ---- Independent developer team! ----- I'm an independent game developer and made the game all by myself - which explains the basic graphics (I like to think of them as clean ;)).

Please wait to listen to instructions tips and game narrative between levels. Triple tap to progress to the next level or tap the on screen buttons. KNOWN ISSUES We have a number of known issues as far as accessibility is concerned in the simple space shooter. For users with no sight please try with and without headset or ear buds (and please make sure you have left ear / right ear set up correctly) Known Issues 1. There is no specific support for native voice over / screen reader for either iOS or Android. Instead users of all devices need to be connected to the internet to have TTS. However we request you toggle voice over if the game seems to have stopped. Right at the start iOS users are asked by their phone to allow location information. This may also help after level 1 completion where you are asked to enter your email. 2. Upon completing each level (to the sound of cheers and applause) pause and wait instructions if no instructions come triple tap to continue. 3. Upon completing level 1 you should receive an important message about "Incarnation" this is effectively your birth into the a future fantasy game world that will link all our forthcoming games and or iterations of this game. Make a note of your username should you need to contact us for support. There is an issue accessing the email registration form if you have no sight we found our daughter needed help at this point and we are looking for suggestions to overcome this. 4. The game over screen has three buttons and they are not accessible unfortunately this means non sighted users will get stuck in a loop of continuing at the level they reached until they complete the game.

com.Company.ProductNameJK000034,Cat's Memory - Baby Songs FREE,Ikcilbuk,Free,A memory game for kids about singing baby songs. Game for children that you can easily turn into a sing along fun. Memorize the sequence of cats while they sing their melody and then repeat it! Designed for young kids. 1. Watch the finger that points at the cats one after another 2. Tap the cats in the same order to repeat the song "Cat music - Baby songs" is a game for kids not for advertisers. * No ads * No in-app purchases * Difficulty is adequate for three year old children * Simple interface Meet seven cats: Pink Fluffy Red Paw Redhead Yell-Aww Ginger Purple Tom and Green Feline. They do their best to meow miaow and mew classic child songs. They sing old American Chinese and Polish folk songs because why not? It's a game about remembering after all! They even meow Chopin! But "Cat music - Baby songs" is not only about kid music! Cats play a MEMORY GAME with young girls and boys. When a child makes a mistake cats hiss and sing out-of tune but then they help out by giving hints. Kittens wave ears to attract attention and I that doesn't help summon the mighty Finger the Bandmaster. There are several types of hints - visual and voice suggestions. "Baby music - cat songs" is a game similar to "Simon Says" but less abstract and more simple. Minor's goal is to tap cats in order to replay their song. The sequence is presented in the most natural way: a big in-game finger points the cats. Infant should follow this instruction and repeat the sequence. It's super-easy like preschool games but it's not mindless! When a youngster succesfully repeats the song your little player actually has a sense of satisfaction. The game is made by a father tested by kids and iterated many times each melody is easy enough. Melody timing is based on music notation but also slowed down where necessary to reduce difficulty. Is watching and repeating the song too easy? Then try to copy the tempo and harmony of the presented tune! Or on the contrary: play this game like a "cat piano" hit random sounds and watch furry musicians doing silly faces. My son wasn't interested in singing but after playing "Cat music - Baby Songs" at first he started meowing then humming then asking about the lyrics and finally singing along with me! I believe this game is a perfect opportunity for starting a sing along fun with your little girl or boy. So if you've got a child in a preschool or even nursery age why don't you replace those greedy "apps for children" made by major publishers infested with ads and in-app purchases (hey Tale Fong Pink Tab Toono Toots) and try "Cat music - Baby Songs" for a moment. At least it attempts to deliver a valuable experience tailored for young kids. Have fun! Ingredients: * Seven cute cats * Six emotional animations * Five songs ten more here: https://goo.gl/ERlHZI * Twenty two meows of different pitch In conclusion: Is it a proper game for kids? Yes! A game for children? Yes! A kid game kids game or a kidsgame? Definitely! A playground game? No. Does it implant some extra memory in toddlers? No it just develops their own naturally :) Is it about baby songs? Not only! Is this game convenient for children? Absolutely! Does it match cognitive competence of a three year old? Tested and confirmed. My opinion about other games for kids? Pou wouldn't play them. Can children be taught singing with this app? It helps. Is it a puzzle game? No. Can it improve concentration? Yes on a preschool level. What this game will improve in a little player? Attitide towards singing. Is it like other learning games? No it's a toy first of all. 4 kids? Sure. Concerning kid memory? Yes kids memory games does challenge kids memory. Will my little player be quiet and entertained at the same time? YES! Additional guiding from a parent necessary? No. Musical instruments used? Cats. Kid-friendly kids fun 4kids? Naturally! Fur kinder?

air.A2ToneColor,2-Tone Color - Autism Series,ColorsKit,€4.01 Buy,2-Tone Color - Autism Series is a special education app developed by WebTeam Corporation to help children with autism distinguish between 2 different shades in a single object. The app built on the applied behavior analysis (ABA) method of intervention asks the child to touch an object with 2 different colors. Each screen comes with a distractor object to make the task of identifying difficult for the child. In the app settings parents or teachers can customize playing time and a few other features to suit the requirement of their child or students. Whenever the child gives a correct response s/he will receive a rewarding animation that reinforces good performances. ***About WebTeam Corporation*** Incorporated in 2005 WebTeam Corporation is a Somerset-based mobile application development firm that has pioneered the development of an autism management program comprising screening assessment and intervention apps. WebTeam’s ABA-based autism apps help parents teachers health care experts researchers and other stakeholders worldwide efficiently manage the entire life-cycle of autism from infancy to adulthood and employment. By developing apps for autism intervention WebTeam replicates individualized autism services on mobile devices thereby making these necessary services available to the under-served population globally especially in countries that lack the expertise necessary to tackle autism efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. WebTeam’s innovative idea backed by proprietary technology which was awarded by Verizon in the 2013 Powerful Answers Award competition lets caregivers collect and share data efficiently to foster effective collaborations that will ultimately solve one of the world’s largest and growing developmental disorders.

Okay maybe it wasn't written by babies but it was exclusively designed with your babies and toddlers in mind and has been extensively beta-tested by a top-notch team of babies (aka my two beautiful nieces Ava and Hailey). Open this app hand your phone to your baby and sit back while you enjoy countless hours of uninterrupted "you time". I have spent over 100 hours developing this app with unique features to grab your baby's attention and keep them entertained and captivated for hours. These features include: ○ Multi-finger scrolling ○ Omni-directional scrolling ○ Infinite scrolling ○ Cute icons and music This game will also help your toddler develop their young minds. Learn animal names and sounds letters and words numbers and simple math problems. Oh let's not forget to mention that this app has a locking feature which makes it extremely difficult for a child to exit the app unless they know what they are doing (press your phone's back button or the exit tile 10 times in a row). No more unexpected charges on your cell-phone bill changes to your settings or opening that folder you thought you hid so well. While running Baby's First App intercepts the home button to make sure that your 2 year old is not perusing your data. Keep them in the game where they are safe and captivated.

No extra icons will show up in your launcher. ___________________________ This app was written for my 2 nieces (ages 2 and 3) after I was unable to find a suitable app for them. This app was specifically geared towards toddlers. Something easy to pick up and play nothing frustrated and extremely simple. It requires zero supervision keeps your child inside the app and last but not least educational.

com.avrinross.wordowlkindergarten,Word Owl's Word Search - K,Avrin Ross,€0.72 Buy,Word Owl's Word Search - Kindergarten is a neat big and colorful word search with sight words for kids that's designed for tablets. This Kindergarten Edition of Word Owl's Word Search features over 100 sight words for children in or around Kindergarten. These words have been gathered from numerous sight word lists provided by real Kindergarten classes in different schools. Help your kid learn and retain several words while having fun! This word search will help your kid learn how to spell and decipher words. Your child's reading quality should also increase as they start comprehending sight words easier. √ Over 100 different sight words √ 10 words to find per puzzle √ Customizable letter and background colors √ Sharp colorful retina resolution graphics Simply slide your finger across the letters to form a word that's displayed on the left side of the screen. The words are in the word search vertically horizontally and diagonally. All of the words are displayed in a forward facing manner. Have fun! (Sight words are commonly used words that children are encouraged to memorize as a whole by sight so that they can automatically recognize these words when they see them without having to use any distracting strategies. Sight words account for a large percentage of the words used in literature for children. One advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that the child will be able to identify the majority of words in a book before they even attempt to read it. When the child is able to do that they'll be able to concentrate on the meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop to figure out the actual word.)

com.yogome.HalloweenHeroes,Halloween Edu-Game for Kids,Yogome Inc.,Free,Who said Halloween can’t be educational? In Halloween Heroes players must dare themselves to enter spooky places like haunted houses and pirate ships in order to take care of all the trash left over from Halloween festivities. And you can bet it’s a big mess to clean up. Just think about all the trash we leave behind come October. Jack O’Lanterns are left to rot plastic bats and spiders wind up all over the streets and discarded costumes clutter up the garbage. Halloween Heroes challenges children ages 4-10 to take care of the mess we leave behind through composting and sustainable recycling. Players help witches sort trash plunder haunted houses for recyclables and compost different types of organic waste in order to plant new trees. Along the way children learn the differences between plastics metals paper and organic waste as well as how recycling can lead to the creation of new products from old materials. But it’s not all about recycling either - kids can also have fun making their own costumes from recyclable material like toilet paper and milk cartons. After dressing up their “Yogotars” with their spookiest outfits players can dress up in their best Halloween costumes for all their friends to see. Recycling still isn’t as widespread as it should be and a part of the problem comes from a lack of existing educational materials on recycling especially in third-world countries. Halloween Heroes seeks to solve the problem by making recycling fun and easy to understand. LEARN ABOUT RECYCLING IN REAL TIME - The world of Yogome is throwing a big Halloween bash and all Yogotars are invited! - 15 different missions... - Learn how to use household materials to make Halloween costumes and decorations - Tutorials in both English and Spanish Yogome creates fun iOS educational games for 21st-century kids. By joining the Yogome Squad children can learn about languages math science the environment nutrition and other life skills. They’ll have so much fun they won’t even notice they’re learning! From our educational experts: Halloween Heroes gives your child a comprehensive understanding of how recycling works and why it’s effective in reducing waste and creating new products. This game encourages children ages 4-10 to learn about the different types of recyclables and sort them in order to develop real-world recycling skills. It also teaches them about composting a lesser-known form of recycling for organic materials. Players enter different Halloween-themed locations in the Yogome universe during the in order to track down errant trash and stop it in its tracks. Each mission sees players accomplishing a different goal from helping witches sort plastics from paper to planting new trees with composted soil. Parents can track their child's progress through an easy-to-use Dashboard.,October 29 2013,Education Action & Adventure,4.0 105 total,5000 - 10000,USK: All ages,2.2 and up,https://www.google.com/url?q=http://yogome.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEUZOdd4nEK5Q9qtsmHM00-HBVolQ * mailto:manolo@yogome.com * https://www.google.com/url?q=http://yogome.com/home/privacypolicy.html&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHHUM_7YXhirB_poFQ6lC76-gm00A,http://yogome.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEUZOdd4nEK5Q9qtsmHM00-HBVolQ,http://yogome.com,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yogome.HalloweenHeroes&hl=en

air.Nordavinden,Troll i ord - Nordavinden,GROM as,€3.98 Buy,Eventyret om gutten som gikk til Nordavinden for å kreve igjen melet er et spennende og humoristisk eventyr om den fattige og sultne gutten som tre ganger går til Nordavinden. Han får god hjelp men treffer samtidig på de grådige gjestgiverne. Men gutten er lur og rettferdigheten seirer til slutt. Barna kan lytte til eventyret bla fra side til side og få estetiske og språklige opplevelser gjennom eventyret som formidles. Gjennom hele fortellingen kan de veksle mellom språkene. Materiellet passer særlig godt for barn i alderen 1 til 7 år og egner seg godt i barnegrupper der flere språk er representert. Når barna kan forstå og oppleve eventyret på norsk og andre morsmål kan man skape en felles referanseramme for videre lek og målrettet arbeid. Slik styrkes barnas språkkompetanse samtidig som eventyrets fiksjon fremmer fantasi og kreativitet. Gjennom Troll i ords eventyrunivers møter barna kjente norske folkeeventyr og eventyr med opprinnelse fra andre deler av verden.

Our interactive application consists of nicely illustrated stories designed in calm pastel colours with thoroughly thought out logic of vocalization that lulls a kid slowly and a smart system of logging off in case a kid falls asleep with a tablet. ABILITY - There are two variants of what to do with a fairy tale: listening mode which is activated after pressing the “sheep” icon and reading mode activated with a help of the “gnat”; - The possibility to stop the narration at any moment to continue or to browse within any sentences or pages of the text; - Putting the bookmark at any point for quick search where you stopped last time; - Music tuning within the app narrator’s voice adjustment at the tablet side part; - Gradual reduction of the monitor brightness when the story is about to end tells a child that the app is falling asleep and it’s time to go to bed. After complete fade the app shows no reaction to touches except one button.

com.digitaldecisions.rolypolysheepfree,Roly Poly Sheep (Free),Digital Decisions,Free,There's gold in them thar hills and Roly Poly Sheep are collecting it and playing on the way to their pasture. Roly Poly is out to find friends but must graze and collect coins to free them. This is a game for all ages because youngsters can simply enjoy the cute sheep fun 3D motion sounds music and reactions. Adults can appreciate the increasing challenge and the physics behind the rolling sheep and enjoy the funny little critters too! This game is somewhat reminiscent of the little pocket games that you tilt to roll little balls to a goal. Start the game with your phone/tablet level (as if it has a marble on it). You control the round little sheep by simply tilting your phone or tablet in the direction they should roll. Roll the funny little sheep around collecting coins. When you get all the sheep in the fenced pasture they give off a poof of joy and then they start a new round with a fresh batch of coins. If you have enough coins a new sheep is bought and added to your fold and you can collect gold coins all the quicker! At first you have one little roly poly lamb and it is fairly easy to bring him to the pasture to start another round but after you've earned a few more sheep it becomes a bit more challenging (and fun)! A few hints... - You can zoom the camera out by doing a pinching motion on the screen. - You can follow a single sheep by tapping on it. It will baaa spin and give a poof too. - To go back to auto-zoom just tap anywhere else on the screen. - If a sheep falls out of the playing area it just starts at the beginning again. Our team has a gazillion ideas on additional features for the game so please stay tuned!,August 22 2015,Arcade Pretend Play,5.0 2 total,100 - 500,Everyone,2.3 and up,https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEPu1k3eH3qYNZ-1qD4T9NNrQ9Lpw * mailto:digitaldecisions2@gmail.com * https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2/home/privacy-policy&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFpSwn_cZqDwS4QEucVd8o_BY8_1w,https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEPu1k3eH3qYNZ-1qD4T9NNrQ9Lpw,https://sites.google.com,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitaldecisions.rolypolysheepfree&hl=en

com.digitaldecisions.rolypolysheep,Roly Poly Sheep,Digital Decisions,$0.99 Buy,There's gold in them thar hills and Roly Poly Sheep are collecting it and playing on the way to their pasture. Roly Poly is out to find friends but must graze and collect coins to free them. This is a game for all ages because youngsters can simply enjoy the cute sheep fun 3D motion sounds music and reactions. Adults can appreciate the increasing challenge and the physics behind the rolling sheep and enjoy the funny little critters too! This game is somewhat reminiscent of the little pocket games that you tilt to roll little balls to a goal. Start the game with your phone/tablet level (as if it has a marble on it). You control the round little sheep by simply tilting your phone or tablet in the direction they should roll. Roll the funny little sheep around collecting coins. When you get all the sheep in the fenced pasture they give off a poof of joy and then they start a new round with a fresh batch of coins. If you have enough coins a new sheep is bought and added to your fold and you can collect gold coins all the quicker! At first you have one little roly poly lamb and it is fairly easy to bring him to the pasture to start another round but after you've earned a few more sheep it becomes a bit more challenging (and fun)! A few hints... - You can zoom the camera out by doing a pinching motion on the screen. - You can follow a single sheep by tapping on it. It will baaa spin and give a poof too. - To go back to auto-zoom just tap anywhere else on the screen. - If a sheep falls out of the playing area it just starts at the beginning again. Our team has a gazillion ideas on additional features for the game so please stay tuned!,August 13 2015,Arcade Brain Games,4.7 3 total,10 - 50,Everyone,2.3 and up,https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEPu1k3eH3qYNZ-1qD4T9NNrQ9Lpw * mailto:digitaldecisions2@gmail.com * https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2/home/privacy-policy&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFpSwn_cZqDwS4QEucVd8o_BY8_1w,https://sites.google.com/site/digitaldecisions2&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEPu1k3eH3qYNZ-1qD4T9NNrQ9Lpw,https://sites.google.com,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitaldecisions.rolypolysheep&hl=en

Наше обучающее интерактивное приложение – это прекрасные милые иллюстрированные истории в спокойных пастельных тонах продуманная логика озвучивания медленно убаюкивающая малыша и «умная» система выхода из приложения если ребенок уснул вместе с планшетом. ВОЗМОЖНОСТИ - Понятный для ребенка интерфейс ограничивающий случайные покупки. Эта функция доступна только после разблокирования – «перетаскивания» иконки замочка после чего становится активной ссылка на сайт магазина где можно приобрести платную версию книги; - Отключите подключение к Интернету чтобы ребенок не открыл окно браузера после случайного нажатия иконок социальных сетей; - Два варианта взаимодействия со сказкой: режим прослушивания который включается при нажатии на иконку «Овечка» и режим самостоятельного чтения – с помощью «Комарика»; - Возможность остановки рассказчика на произвольном моменте продолжение озвучивания и перемещения между любыми предложениями текста и страницами истории; - Установка закладки на любой странице для быстрого поиска места где вы в последний раз остановились; - Регулировка фоновой музыки внутри приложения а регулировка голоса рассказчика – на боковой панели планшета; - Постепенное уменьшение яркости экрана после завершения сказки подсказывает ребенку что приложение «засыпает» и малышу тоже пора спать.

com.jadkinsenterprises.traprescue,Trap Rescue,Jerry Adkins,$0.99 Buy,Trap Rescue is a 3D game with a retro look.The objective is to move your player past the red enemies and rescue the hostage that is hidden at the end of the trap. Scores are increased when you pick up yellow tokens along the way. There is a time limit for each level. If the allowed time expires you must repeat that level again. When the hostage is rescued the level is won and the main menu appears. Each level won generates a button in the main menu so you can choose to replay any levels you want. There are 12 levels in this game. If favorable reviews are received then more levels will be added with future updates. The game is played by tilting your device to maneuver the player through the trap to rescue the hostage. Initially your Android device must be held like you are taking a photo. Since this is a 3D game the player moves right and left plus closer and farther away to move through the trap to rescue the hostage. Initially you have to make it past the red guard paroling the entrance to the trap. Any time you touch any red guard or other enemy you are destroyed and re-appear outside the trap. The countdown time is still counting down to zero. Each level is slightly harder than the previous level. It starts out easy and gets harder with each level. This is a simple game with simple graphics. It is fun to play.

com.oki.phonenew,Kids game: baby phone,GoKids!,Free,“Baby phone” is an engrossing educational game for young children. The app will help parents turn the ordinary smartphone into an entertaining and exciting children's toy. The young player will be introduced various animals and their best sounds while taking the opportunity to learn numbers and play a fun button-hitting game. Features and advantages of the game: - The game presents 20 different animals both domestic and wild along with the sounds they produce for the toddler to learn and appreciate. The appearance of animals is introduced by a bunch of funny pictures while their sounds can always be heard on the other end of the line. Communication with animals helps to develop kid’s interpersonal skills and curiosity. - The simple game will help your child learn the numbers which it furnishes in bright and colorful buttons and addicting games. - The opportunity to make a call with the selected animal picking up the phone after a few buzzers is the most exciting part of the game. A whole zoo is awaiting for the kid in the phone book. Here are: squirrel sheep snake goat cow kitten chicken rooster lion elephant horse mouse monkey panda penguin parrot pig dog tiger and duck. - The simple and intuitive game interface causes no difficulties even for children of kindergarten age. How to play in our kindergarten game: - Call up an animal. Hit the call button to see the full list of animals as pictures in the phone book. The kid touches the picture he or she likes and the animal takes the call within a few seconds. - Play with the buttons. The arcade mini-game requires the child to focus attention on the buttons shown on the screen. When the game begins one of the buttons starts tilting. The task is to hit the wobbling one to score. If the child misses the button will continue to swing until being hit. - Take calls from the animals. Now and then you will receive calls from your animal friends! “Babyphone” can be easily transformed from a simple preschool game into a genuine discovery educational tool for improving your child's skills. The way you first introduce the numbers to your toddler is crucial since it should be exciting enough to spark the interest in the kid. Tell your babe about the numbers displayed on the screen. Toddler games are very helpful for nanny and babysitter that help infants learn and play without parent assist. Learning about new animals will broaden the outlook of your toddler and help develop the skill to distinguish between the sounds they make. Come up with some rhymes to the names of the animals for your child to remember them easier. These could be for example 'a goat on the road' or 'a cat in a hat' etc. All the animal sounds presented in the game are clear and distinct so the young player is unlikely to confuse them. The unusual presentation of the sounds in the form of a phone call is bound to give a greater effect than a simple explanation of what this or that animal says. You can also play “Babyphone” with your child while going out for a walk. Upon catching sight of a cat or dog offer the kid to call up the animal and listen to what it says. The button-hitting part of the game will help solidify the newly obtained knowledge about numbers. Encourage your child not only to touch the tilting buttons but to name the numbers depicted in them that will help them at school in future. When hit buttons produce piano sounds. Offer your child to compose a melody of their own on this virtual piano. Such creative activity is certain to keep your kid busy for a rather long while with funny games.

br.com.plugandboom.chilicrab,Chili Crab - The Musical Notes,Plug and Boom,Free,Chili Crab - The Musical Notes is a game created by artists and educators to teach kids in a fun and engaging way the names and the sequence of the musical notes as well as their positions on the note staff. The content is based on a methodology developed over more than 40 years at “Núcleo Villa-Lobos de Educação Musical” a renowned music school in the brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. The app contains three different games: 1 - Lead Note game By helping Chili Crab escape from Le Shark the sinister french shark your child will have a first contact with the names of the musical notes and their ascending (do - re - mi - fa - sol - la - si) and descending (do - si - la - sol - fa - mi - re) sequences. 2 - Neighbor Note game In this game the child will experience what have been learned about the notes sequence to help Chili Crab collect musical notes passing through the screen. The notes must be collected in a certain order that changes at each play but always according to the notes ascending and descending sequences. To make it even more fun the levels are full of collectable coins and power-ups to help the player. 3 - Musical Staff game This last game works just like the Neighbor Note game but now a staff of notes indicates to the child which note should be collected. In the last two levels of this game the names of the notes won’t even be displayed anymore and your little musician will naturally use the knowledge acquired during the previous levels to read the staff with minimum effort. CONTACT If you run into any problem with the app please send us an e-mail before writing a negative review. Our e-mail is contato@plugandboom.com.br (Don’t worry about it being a brazillian address. You can write us in english). We can’t reply to reviews (there is no way to do it) but we will be glad to answer your e-mails and help with any unexpected problem.

Great logic puzzles. I've loved logic puzzles like you find in Dell puzzle magazines and these are every bit as good. I also like how they take the same basic puzzle and rework it so it runs from easy to difficult. They also produce multiple volumes of puzzles so you can get new ones. I suspect I'll replay many of these after some time has passed so I'll get many hours of enjoyment out of this app. ★★★★★ by Totoro. Flawless Implementation of the Logic Puzzle on Tablets. This is exactly what I was hoping it would be when I purchased the game. I works exactly like the pen-and-paper version of the puzzles and provides a good spectrum of difficulty. The best feature is the ability to "remove mistakes" from the playfield. Since I never make any mistakes(lol) it can also be used to "reassure" you that you aren't going down the wrong path if you get stuck. ★★★★★ by Suzy D. I've been looking for exactly this game for a year now. This type of logic puzzle was just waiting for a tech boost -- automatic fill-in and no dreaded erasing! The interface is perfect: the controls are intuitive and there's even a note section for when it helps to get your thoughts in order. Logic Puzzles are popular preparation for the LSAT and GMAT Logical Reasoning sections and similar deductive exams. Solve these puzzles to keep yourself sharp! Note: Some reviews suggest there are logic errors. As far as we know there are none. Contact us with a screenshot if you disagree or get a hint which will show which clue still has information for you to use. Every five puzzles are grouped together with their own background story. Each group has a range of puzzles that get progressively harder. Each puzzle includes statistics for its average completion time. See how your time compares! Many additional volumes are available for in-app purchase and more are added regularly. Optimized for mobile this modern solver has multi-level Undo and the Auto-X features make it easier and quicker to focus on the logic. Keep short notes along with the puzzle to help you make your way to the solution.

Giving toddlers and kindergartners the chance to play their way to becoming better counters Number Fiesta is both fun and educational. Structuring the learning process as a game is one of the most effective teaching methods and with games that are as entertaining and vibrant as they are educational Number Fiesta’s four unique counting challenges give your young ones the perfect opportunity to get started on developing their numbers skills. The most simple game in the app is Count which encourages kids to count along with a fun audio track while each counted number is highlighted on-screen. The app’s quiz game challenges kids to count how many cartoon items appear in front of them. The objects themselves don’t matter so users only need to worry about counting while a helpful multiple choice answer key lets them narrow down the right answer from three possible options. Blending a classic memory game format with numbers Number Fiesta’s Matching game pushes users to match multiple pairs of numbers from a grid of cards. The catch is that they can only flip one card at a time meaning they must recognize various numbers and remember their positions on the board to succeed!

com.dberm22.BabysFirstApp.ProKey,Baby's First App Pro Key,dberm22,€1.49 Buy,★★★★★ Pro Key ★★★★★ To use the app you must have both this and Baby's First App (Free) http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dberm22.BabysFirstApp installed. This app merely removes the 5-day expiration of the trial version. Don't worry this app does not use any battery memory and negligible hard-drive space. No extra icons will show up in your launcher. ________________________________________ ★★★Filled with catchy music and lots of bright flashing colours I am sure it will keep any young ones interested. I find the interaction surprisingly lots of fun for me that is. I just know younger ones are bound to love it even more.- AnndroidOfVirtue.com★★★ Link to article including a video demo visit: http://www.androidofvirtue.com/babys-first-app/ Written for babies by babies! Okay maybe it wasn't written by babies but it was exclusively designed with babies in mind and has been extensively beta-tested by a top-notch team of babies (aka my two beautiful nieces Ava and Hailey). Open this app hand your phone to your child and sit back while you enjoy countless hours of uninterrupted "you time". I have spent over 100 hours developing this app with unique features to grab your baby's attention and keep them entertained and captivated for hours. These features include: ○ Multi-finger scrolling ○ Omni-directional scrolling ○ Infinite scrolling ○ Cute icons and music This app will also help your child develop their young brains. Learn animal names and sounds letters and words numbers and simple math problems. Oh let's not forget to mention that this app has a locking feature which makes it extremely difficult for a child to exit the app unless they know what they are doing (press your phone's back button or the exit tile 10 times in a row). No more unexpected charges on your cell-phone bill changes to your settings or opening that folder you thought you hid so well. While running Baby's First App intercepts the home button to make sure that your 2 year old is not perusing your data. Keep them in the app where they are safe and captivated. ___________________________ This app was written for my 2 nieces (ages 2 and 3) after I was unable to find a suitable app for them. This app was specifically geared towards toddlers. Something easy to pick up and play nothing frustrated and extremely simple. It requires zero supervision keeps your child inside the app and last but not least educational.
